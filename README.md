# learning

The goal of this project is to provide practical knowlege of programing and teach you how to do the most with it in the shortest ammount of time. Too many tutorials on the web do not connect technologies and leave you wondering, "whats next?" or "how do I apply this?". In this tutorial we will be introducing you to the latest programming technology and techneques to create WEB, Desktop and mobile applications. After you complete this tutorial you should be able to create your own web application and have the skills to learn new technologies not covered by this tutorial as well as solve any issues you come across!

All of the text books in this repo are free licence and can be found at [goalkicker.com](https://goalkicker.com) (textbooks in repo are up to date as of October 5, 2019).

We have created assignments to go over the largest components of each technology, but may not directly follow the textbook. Each assignment will have a corisonding chapter in the textbook or aditional reading for you to learn the concept prior to attempting the assignment. It is a good idea to read the entire textbook as it goes into more detail, however we are focusing on the largest concepts.

We will be going over several different technologies and languages, however we can not cover all programming technologies, we encourge you to get resouces from [goalkicker.com](https://goalkicker.com) to continue learning as well as [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) youtube channel & [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/). However we will cover the following technologies:

1. [HTML 5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp)
2. [CSS 3](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/)
3. [JavaScript (ES6)](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/)
4. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
5. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
6. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
