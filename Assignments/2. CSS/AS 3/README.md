# CSS Assingmnet 3 (CHAPTER 7)

**In this section we will be discussing the Box Modle**

<br>

## Steps

1. Create a css file and link it to the starting HTML file.
2. add 20px of padding to the first p tag.
3. add 20px of margin to the second p tag.
4. add 20px of both margin and padding to the third p tag.
5. add 50px of padding to just the top of the fourth p tag.

## Conclutions

Hopefully after going through these steps you understand how the box modle works. Basically padding keeps the size of the eliment but condences the content, and margin reduces the size around the actual eliment.

As you can see we have been using the unit of pixels for sizing and in our next assignment we will be going over different units of measure, and discuss absolute over responsive units.
