# CSS Assingmnet 8 (Chapter 16)

**In this assignment we will be going over how to use the powerful and dynamic flexbox display type. It should be noted that the textbook is not the best resource for flexbox, take a look at this website [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)**

In this assignment we will be applying the flexbox display type to the navigation bar to really show off its power.

## Steps

1. Take your completed files from the last assignment.
2. Display the nav as flex.
3. Make sure anchors have a different background color than the nav, no text decoration, a text color of white, and a border radius of 15px.
4. Have the color of the anchors change on hover.
3. Have the eliments in the nav display as a column.
4. Do not allow the anchors to wrap.
5. Justify the content so that the space around each eliment is even.
6. Add 10px of padding and 5px of margin around each anchor.
7. Align the text of each anchor to the middle.

## Conclutions

Take note how we style our overall page with grid to get the overall form and use flexbox to style most of the content in lists or dynamic data. This is a common layout for most pages. Keep in mind that grid is used to give overall structure and flexbox is used to add a more flowing way to display things, and makes vertical and horisantal allignment very simple.
