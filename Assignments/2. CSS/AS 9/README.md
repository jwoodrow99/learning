# CSS Assingmnet 9 (Chapter 13)

**One of the most important concepts in web development is making it accessable and readbale on all device sizes. You may be wondering how to style your page to make it look good on a cell phone as well as a website, in order to do this we will be using media queries. Media queries allow for you to have different styles enabled when the screen or window size is at a certain size**

NOTE: min-width is triggered when the screen is larger than that size, and max-width is triggered when the screen is smaller than that size.

## Steps

1. Open the starting file, we have changes a few styles to make the navigation a horistal layout.
2. Add a "media only screen" break to be triggered at 767 pixles and lower (most common for smart phones).
3. when the breakpint triggers, change the nav bar to display vertically.

## Conclutions

Not the biggest difference between a desktop website and a mobile website is switching it from a horisantal layout on desktop to a vertical layout on mobile phones. you have seen that if you use grid and flexbox it is as simple as chaging the grid layout at a different screen size and changing flexbox from a horisantal layout to a vertical.

Take note that if you change a property in one of your media quires, you must set a value for the same property in your default styles otherwise it will not change back.
