<br>

## Steps

1. Create a css file and link it to the starting HTML file.
2. Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and find the Roboto font, and use the css import directive to import the font for use.
3. Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and find the Open Sans font, and use the standard HTML link to import it for use.
4. Make one of the divs use Roboto, and the other use Open Sans.

## Conclutions

Google fonts is a good source for free fonts. What is happeing as when the page gets loaded we pull the stylesheet for the roboto and open sans fonts from the google server so we do not need to have the files ourself, we are simply linking to another file on another server.

Open sans and Roboto are the 2 most popular fonts to use on the web right now as they are highly readable, clear, and well spaced. It is a good idea to use one of these fonts for non display text (display text is text for things such as logos).

Other best practices for tect people are suposed to read on the web is to gve it a padding of 10px and let the section with the text be no wider than 80 characters (We will learn how to dea with this once we reach media rules.)
