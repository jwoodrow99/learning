**Chapter 1 gives us allot of information however we will simply focus on how to get css on our pages**

## Steps

1. Open the starting file and you will notice 3 different p tags.
2. Create an external css file and link it to your file.
3. Add the style rule to change the text color to red of the p tag with id p1 in the external file.
4. Create and internal style to change the text color of the p tag with id p2 to green.
5. Add an inline style to the p tag with id p3 to change the text color to blue.

## Conclutions

We have added css styles in 3 different ways, through an external file, internal tag, and inline style. Best practice says that you should almost always use an external file. An external file allows for you to keep things more organized and apply that one css file to multiple html pages.
