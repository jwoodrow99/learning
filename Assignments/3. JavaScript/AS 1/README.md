Note in order to access the console log, right click anywhere on the webpage and click inspect and it will open the web debugging tools. Then go to the console tab and you should see your console log there.

## Steps

1. Create a JavaScript file and link it to the starting HTML file with the defer attrinute.
2. Create a p tag with the id of name in the html file.
3. In your javascript file create a prompt that asks for the users name.
4. Use the DOM API to to change the value of that p tag to the value that was entered by the prompt.
5. Then console log the variable to see the value.

## Conclutions

As you will notice everything in the javascript file gets executed from top to bottom in order, and as we know from the HTML assignments, the defer attribute is important to allow for the entire page to load prior to the JavaScript loading.

Also take note that the javascript will re run every time the page refreshes.
