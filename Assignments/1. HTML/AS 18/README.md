# HTML Assingmnet 18

**In this assingment we will be creating diferent types of inputs and submitting it to an API**

<br>

## Steps

1. Take your finished file from AS17 and copy it into AS18.
2. Wrap all of your input fields in a form tag.
3. Make sure each inout emiment has a name attribute, or the field will not be submitted.
4. Make the form method Post and the action the URL of the Learning API [https://jackwoodrow.io/LearningAPI/](https://jackwoodrow.io/LearningAPI/).

<br>

## Conclutions

After you submit the form you will be redirected to the URL of the API and you should see an array (which we will discuss latter) that contains the name of the field and the value for all of the fields you have created. This api is designed to simply display all of the information that was sent to it, however in actual practice an api would have a task to do such as authenticating a user or getting some sort of information from your database, and your form would send login information or the information required to find the information in the database.
