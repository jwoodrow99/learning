# HTML Assingmnet 2

**In this assingment we will be showing the differences between doctypes**

HTML is a version of the XML data markup language. The use of XML is to add context to data, such as being able to tell the difference between something that is a paragraph or heading. HTML is just a standardized version of XML for the web, however you can create your own version of HTML or use an already existing version.

## Steps

1. Create the basic HTML layout
2. Add some content to the body
2. Change the doctype to "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"

<br>

## Conclutions

You should see a slight difference in how things are spaced or formatted. By changing the doctype you are basically telling the browser to render your HTML differently. Most of the time you simply want to use "html" as the doctype.
