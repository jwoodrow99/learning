NOTE: The div eliment is basically a wildcard, you should try to use your tags to describ the information withing them, however sometimes you need a wildcard eliment for unique situations, this is where the div eliment comes in as it does not have any meaning on its own, unlink the article or p tag for example.

## Steps

2. Withing the body create a header with a nav nested inside, and 3 links nested inside the nav.

4. Within the main tag create a section tag, with an article with a header and several p tages within it.
4. Create a footer tab below the main tag.
