# Learning HTML

**This Folder contains all of the assignments that follow along with the GoalKicker HTML 5 textbook. The assignments do not follow each chapter in the textbook, however each assignment will have a corisponding chapter to read in the textbook.**

NOTE: The textbook goes into far more detail about HTML than our assignments will cover.
